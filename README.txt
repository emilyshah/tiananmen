***** Using the Data Visualization *****

Make sure that files d3.min.js and vis.html are in the same file folder.

Double click vis.html to open it in your local browser. I recommend using at least Chrome version 57.0.2987.98; the d3 library may not work for older browsers.

Take care to not toggle the speed buttons too quickly; you may skip a day. 

When progression ends, refresh the page to run again.

Quotations indicate actual headlines in The People's Daily, otherwise I have created my own from a summary of their coverage.
